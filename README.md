# Organizer-Automator
The File Organizer is a Python program that automatically organizes files in a directory based on their type, it saves you time and helps keep your files organized.

How it works
The program uses a dictionary with file types and their corresponding directories, For example, the image files are stored in an "Images" directory, PDF files are stored in a "PDFs" directory and so on.

To use the program, simply specify the directory you want to organize and the program will move all files to their corresponding directories and if a directory for a file type does not exist, the program will create one.
